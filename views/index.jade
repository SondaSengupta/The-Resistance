            The Resistance is a game where 5-10 players try to take down the government.
            Players take turns being the "leader" who selects other members of the team
            to go on missions. The players will go through 5 missions and will win if
            they complete 3 missions. However, some players are secretly spies for the
            government and will try to fail the missions. Try to figure out who is a spy
            and don't vote them for missions and vote down the team selection when they
            are chosen, or if you are a spy try to fail 3 missions, but don't be discovered
            by the Resistance!
